# Description: 
For any industry, the most important thing are it's asset, both human and its' technology (equipments) which runs the entire industry. Any damage varying from minor to minor details to major issues can cause catastrophic failure and a loss of crores of rupees. To avoid it, just like humans have their realtime health monitoring (like heartbeat measurement, hydration level check etc) the machines can also be modified to get real time status, their condition monitoring and aleart generation when any fault occurs. This was the aim of this project.

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome
1. Searching for the logics that can calculate the remaining health of equipments using the limited signals provided by the industries
   - Our team overcame it by going through several documentations and research papers and finally were able to find good methods which solved the purpose. Some of them were developed by the company's R&D Dept. as well. 
2. Reset Conditions Implementation 
   - By investing a lot of time to read about various counters and getting in details of each of them, the hurdle was crossed.
3. SQL server incompatibility with the technologies available
   - The older version which was compatible with both of them was purchased and used 
4. Because of COVID the staging process was getting delayed and hence the trails
   - The enthusiastic team members who were on site, with their dedication and hard work completed the process in required time
