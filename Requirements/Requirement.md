# Requirements

## Introduction: 

The problem that any industry faces is unexpected shutdown of certain units. There are various faults that remain undetected, reason being the limitation on number of work force, it is not possible to get real time data and if somehow using sensor it is achieved, it might not be possible to assess that data for thousands of assets and plan the maintenance. The major issue arises when a momentary peak fault arises and remains undetected. it's contribution to life degradation remains unconsidered and soon the asset shuts down the whole unit causing loss of money and very high maintenance cost. Hence there is a need of smart solution to this problem, the tool which can help the engineers to plan the maintenance, perform condition monitoring and suggest the required solutions that shall be implemented to protect any shut downs. Another required parameter is expected life remaining of the asset which can make their decision quick and efficient. The motivation of the current project is to develop a tool, a tool which, as described in the context, provides a smart solution to the problem that industry faces, there are various ways to solve any problem, target is to build the most efficient and economic one.

## Research: 

There are already several documentations and products available, but to use the latest technologies and to simplify the process, we came up with lates designs and solutions which can make anyone comfortable while using the product, it's so userfriendly that people varying from an operator to a chief engineer can use it quite easily. After going through a lot of documentations and research works done in this field, we started the work on it. 

## Features: 

There are a lot of features, some of them are as follows:   
1. Condition Monitoring System
2. Maintenance Advisory System
3. Alert Generation 
4. Health Status 
5. Severity as per NAMUR standars
