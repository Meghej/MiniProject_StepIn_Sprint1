The problem that any industry faces is unexpected shutdown of certain units. There are
various faults that remain undetected, reason being the limitation on number of work
force, it is not possible to get real time data and if somehow using sensor it is achieved,
it might not be possible to assess that data for thousands of assets and plan the
maintenance. The major issue arises when a momentary peak fault arises and remains
undetected. it's contribution to life degradation remains unconsidered and soon the
asset shuts down the whole unit causing loss of money and very high maintenance cost.
Hence there is a need of smart solution to this problem, the tool which can help the
engineers to plan the maintenance, perform condition monitoring and suggest the
required solutions that shall be implemented to protect any shut downs. Another
required parameter is expected life remaining of the asset which can make their decision
quick and ecient.
The motivation of the current project is to develop a tool, a tool which, as described in
the context, provides a smart solution to the problem that industry faces, there are
various ways to solve any problem, target is to build the most ecient and economic
one.
